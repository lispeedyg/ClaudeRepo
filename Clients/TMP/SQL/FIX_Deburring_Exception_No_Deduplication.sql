ORDER BY Department, Machine

-- ========================================================================
-- EXPLANATION:
-- ========================================================================
/*
The original WHERE clause filters to only show the #1 ranked job per machine.

By adding "OR Department = 'Deburring'", we bypass the deduplication for
ALL jobs in the Deburring department.

This means:
- Swiss, Turning, Milling, Multis, Grinding, Washing: ONE job per machine (as before)
- Deburring: ALL jobs shown (no deduplication)

This works because:
1. Machine-based departments still filter to machine_rank = 1
2. Deburring jobs ALL show regardless of their machine_rank value
3. Both conditions are OR'd together

-- FULL CONTEXT - WHERE TO MAKE THE CHANGE:
-- ========================================================================
/*
Your view structure looks like this:

    JobCompletionPredictions AS (...),
    MachineStatusCTE AS (
        SELECT ...

-- ========================================================================
-- STEP-BY-STEP MODIFICATION GUIDE:
-- ========================================================================
/*
1. Open your view: vw_MachineStatus_GG_WITH_FIRSTRUN.sql
2. Scroll to the VERY END (last ~10 lines)
3. Find this line:
   WHERE machine_rank = 1
   
4. Change it to:
   WHERE 
       machine_rank = 1
       OR Department = 'Deburring'
   
5. Save and execute to update the view
6. Test by querying jobs in Deburring - you should now see BOTH 1317286 AND 1317620
*/

-- ========================================================================
-- AFTER THE CHANGE, RUN THIS TO TEST:
-- ========================================================================
SELECT 
    Machine,
    Department,
    CustomerPartJob,
    MachineStatus,
    ProgressDisplay
FROM THURO.dbo.vw_MachineStatus_GG
WHERE Department LIKE '%Deburr%'
ORDER BY Machine, CustomerPartJob

-- You should now see MULTIPLE jobs per Deburring work center!

-- ========================================================================
-- ALTERNATIVE: If you have MULTIPLE non-machine departments
-- ========================================================================
/*
If you have OTHER departments like Deburring that are also bench work areas,
you can list them all:

WHERE 
    machine_rank = 1
    OR Department IN ('Deburring', 'Washing', 'Assembly')  -- List all non-machine depts
